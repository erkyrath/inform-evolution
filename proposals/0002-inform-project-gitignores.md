# (IE-2) Limited support for placing Inform projects under git source control

## Motive

Inform projects as they stand can be annoying to put under source control.

Both the project folder and the materials folder contain a mixture of things
which must be kept permanently (the source text, pictures used, the IFID, and
such) and ephemera which should be regenerated as needed (binaries as built,
index HTML files, released websites). This means a lot of sorting out if you
want to create a git repository holding an Inform project: source control
ought to worry only about the permanent parts.

This proposal sketches a small change to Inform which would make it play
better with git, at least.

## Proposed changes

1. Each time inform7 works on a project, it writes or updates a .gitignore
file in each of the project and materials directories. This ignores all
ephemeral build or release files generated by Inform.

2. Specifically, it looks for a "stanza" in the form of a run of lines
beginning with the comment line:

	# This stanza written automatically by inform7

and continuing to the comment line:

	# End of stanza written automatically by inform7

If it finds this stanza, it rewrites with a current version. If it does not find
this stanza, it adds it to the bottom of the .gitignore file; if there is no
.gitignore file at present, it creates one, with this stanza as the only content.

Since this happens on every run, any project the user places under source control
which has been compiled even once will be covered by this.

3. If instead inform7 finds the comment line:

	# No stanza written automatically by inform7

then it does nothing to the .gitignore file, and then effectively this feature
does not exist for the project.

4. The intention is for the stanza to use wildcards, and so on, so that its
content need not much change (if at all) as the project changes.
